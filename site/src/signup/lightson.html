        This October, 1 million Americans will celebrate
        <a href="http://afterschoolalliance.org/loa.cfm">Lights On
          Afterschool</a> to rally support for the afterschool programs that
        keep kids safe, inspire them to learn and help working families. Mozilla
        and the Afterschool Alliance want to help you celebrate with a simple,
        fun activity to help build students’ webmaking and digital literacy
        skills.
