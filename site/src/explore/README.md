# HEY THIS IS IMPORTANT

Every page in this directory (save index.html) should have a corresponding
page in `site/src/signup`. The current functionality of the signup script is to
send people on to explore after their signup/login is complete if their signup
page doesnâ€™t have its own redirect. DO NOT PUT ANY PAGE IN THIS DIRECTORY IF IT
DOES NOT HAVE A CORRESPONDING PAGE IN `/signup`.
